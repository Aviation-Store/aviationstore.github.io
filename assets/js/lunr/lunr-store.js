Ingredients      2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour   1 teaspoon baking soda   1/2 teaspoon salt   1 cup butter, softened and cut to pieces   1 cup sugar   1 cup light brown sugar, packed   2 teaspoons vanilla extract   2 large eggs   2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips   1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)   1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)   Directions      Preheat the oven to 350 F.   In a medium bowl, whisk flour with baking soda, nutmeg and salt.   In a large bowl, beat butter with sugar and brown sugar until creamy and light. Add vanilla and eggs, one at a time, and mix until incorporated.   Gradually add dry mixture into the butter-sugar wet blend, mixing with a spatula until combined. Add chocolate chips and nuts until just mixed.   Drop tablespoon-sized clumps onto un-greased cookie sheets. Bake for 8-12 minutes, or until pale brown. Allow to cool on the pan for a minute or three, then transfer cookies to a wire rack to finish cooling.  ","categories": [],
